## Quick Guide to Using the Ironpaw Token Calculator  
  
This guide will walk you through the three key steps: creating your shopping list in-game, exporting the data, and using the calculator to find your profit.  
  
## Add the Shopping List to Auctionator in-game  
This step gets all the relevant item prices from the auction house for you.  
  
Step 1: In the calculator, click the "Copy Search String" button.  
Step 2: Open your AH.  
Step 3: Go to the "Shopping" tab.  
Step 4: While under "Shopping Lists" tap Look for a button labeled "Import". Click it.  
Step 5: Paste the string you copied from the calculator into the import box.  
You now have a shopping list with all the necessary items!  
  
## Export the Search Results from Auctionator  
This step scans the auction house and gets the data you need.  
  
Step 1: In the AH, go to the "Shopping" tab.  
Step 2: Select the shopping list you just created (e.g., "MoP Cooking").  
Step 3: Auctionator is now scanning for the current prices for all the items on your list. This may take a few moments.  
Step 4: Once the scan is complete, in the bottom right is a button labeled "Export Results" Click it.  
Step 5: A window will pop up called "Copy Text" click inside this box and copy all of the text.  
  
## Use the Calculator  
This final step uses the data you've gathered to show you the best way to make a profit.  
  
Step 1: Go to the Ironpaw Token Calculator website. https://za-x-az.github.io/MoP-Classic-Ironpaw-Calculator/  
Step 2: Find the "Import Prices" box.  
Step 3: Paste the text you just copied from Auctionator into this box.  
Step 4: Click the "Import Prices" button.  
  
The calculator will now automatically update with all the new data and show you two main results:  
Cheapest Token Cost: This tells you the item you should buy (and the total cost) to get a single Ironpaw Token for the least amount of gold.  
Profit Analysis: This shows you which item is most valuable to buy with your token and what your potential profit is by reselling it on the auction house.  
  
You can now easily find the most profitable item and start earning gold!
